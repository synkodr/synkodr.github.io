`Edusynk` or "Synkoda Edu" is a small project started by Synkoda.com forum team
for creating a rich library of technical tutorials, examples and references.
However at the time of writing this post this project is not officially
launched.

The project is originally intended to provide content (_i.e_ tutorials, examples, references)
in Sinhalese. But we welcome any language.
